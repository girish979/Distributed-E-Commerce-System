Deliverables for the Project:

	1.	Codebase: Microservices written in Java, Node.js, or Python.
	2.	Documentation:
		- Overview of the system architecture (diagrams and explanations).
        - Clear README on how to run the project locally using Docker Compose.
		- Explanation of distributed principles applied: database replication, caching strategies, message queues, and load balancing.
	3.	GitHub Repo: Ensure all components are clearly documented, including setup instructions.
	4.	Deployed Version (Optional): You can deploy the project on a cloud platform (AWS, GCP, Azure) to demonstrate a real-world environment with scalability.

This project will give you a well-rounded portfolio showing hands-on experience with distributed systems, Kafka, Redis, message queues, and databases. It demonstrates your ability to design, implement, and scale distributed architectures, which is exactly what employers in FAANG+ companies look for.
